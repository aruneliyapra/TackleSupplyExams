7)FORWARD CHAINING:The Standard definition of a forward chaining system states that it is a problem solving technique used by Expert Systems 
when they are faced with a scenario and have to give a solution or conclusion to this scenario.The system will work its way through the 
rules, finding which ones fit and which leads to which using Deductive Reasoning.An inference engine uses forward chaining searches the
inference rules until it finds where the IF clause is known to be true.whenever it can conclude or infer the THEN clause,resulting in
the addition of new information to its dataset.In other words it starts with some facts and applies rule to find all possible conclusions.
therefore forward chaining system is also known as data driven system.

EXAMPLE:
Rules
R1:IF hot AND smoky THEN ADD fire
R2:IF alarm_beeps THEN ADD smoky
R3:if fire THEN ADD switch_on_sprinklers 
Facts
F1:alarm_beeps[Given]
F2:hot[Given]
F3:smoky[from F1 by R2]
F4:fire[from F2,F4 by R1]
F5:switch_on_sprinklers[from F4 by R3]

In a forward chaining system facts are held in a working memory condition-action, rules represents 
actions to take when specified facts occourin working memory.Typically the actions involve adding
or deleting facts from working memory.

Properties of Forward Chaining:
1)All rules which can fire will do fire.
2)Set of rules that can fire is known as conflict set.
3)Decision about which rule to fire--Conflict resolution.

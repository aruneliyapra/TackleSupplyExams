follow a pattern 

a line length not more than 80 colunms.each line in a paragraph should be 4 
characters less(not strictly 4 but  less,easy to read).only three lines per 
paragraph.

Example



#Therefore, if the attributes are left unnormalized, the distance measurements 
#taken on annual salary will generally outweigh distance measurements 
#taken on age.


thats all about rules now add more if you want.

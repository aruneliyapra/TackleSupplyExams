PART A

2)The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions.
The most common applications of SIP are in Internet telephony for voice and video calls, as well as instant messaging, over 
Internet Protocol (IP) networks.The protocol defines the messages that are sent between endpoints, which govern establishment, 
termination and other essential elements of a call. SIP can be used for creating, modifying and terminating sessions consisting of one 
or several media streams. SIP is an application layer protocol designed to be independent of the underlying transport layer. It is a text-based protocol,
incorporating many elements of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

	a)SIP is a signalling protocol used to create, modify, and terminate a multimedia session over the Internet Protocol. 
	  a session is nothing but a simple call between two endpoints. An endpoint can be a smartphone, a laptop, or any device 
	  that can receive and transmit multimedia content over the Internet.
	b)SIP is an application layer protocol defined by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard. 
	  It is defined in RFC 3261.
	c)SIP is incorporated with two widely used internet protocols: HTTP for web browser and SMTP used for email. 
	  From HTTP, SIP borrowed the client-server architecture and the use of URL and URI. From SMTP, it borrowed 
	  a text encoding scheme and a header style.
	d)SIP takes the help of SDP (Session Description Protocol) which describes a session and RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol)
	  used for delivering voice and video over IP network.
	e)SIP can be used for two-party (unicast) or multiparty (multicast) sessions.
	f)Other SIP applications include file transfer, instant messaging, video conferencing, 
	  online games, and steaming multimedia distribution.
